Created repo. I just found out about GitHub pages being a thing - although I'd seen a few of them,
so I kinda knew there something like this existed -, and created this repo in consequence to that.
I'm kind of starting from scratch right now, as I'm starting to explore, but I'm assuming there
are well known templates for these things, which is probably a lot more practical.\
Update : apparently you can use `.md` files for content - well for the main index, anyway - ?\
Anyway, I'll maybe come back to this later.\
Update : added some stuff. I'll also use this as an opportunity to toy around a bit with Web development,
which I don't necessarily do too often.
